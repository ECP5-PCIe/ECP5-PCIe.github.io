- LTSSM was further tested
	- It was found that the domain crossing sometimes doesn't work and that it should be able to run the gateware during test PC boot
	- A ROCKPro64 was ordered for testing
	- More solid domain crossing implementation planned
The FFSynchronizer doesn't like working at certain phases between two clock domains, likely garbling the symbol.
A CDC implementation using an AsyncFIFO should be tested.

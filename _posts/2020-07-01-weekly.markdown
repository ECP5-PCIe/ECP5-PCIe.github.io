- LTSSM implementation revisions
	- LTSSM gets to Configuration.Idle
		- Though further work is required on that, since the test computer sends weird data afterwards instead of IDL symbols
- LTSSM can configure LINK and LANE
	- It doesn't get stuck anymore, besides in Polling.Active.TS, after which configuration continues
